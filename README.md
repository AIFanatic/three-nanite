Note: This project is not finished and the code is not particularly clean or performant.

## Description
An attempt at reproducing a dynamic LOD in threejs similarly to unreal's nanite.
Very far from it but nonetheless a start.
<br>
For now it clusters triangles into a "Cluster hierarchy" and performs merge and simplify (page 46 of Nanite - A Deep Dive).
